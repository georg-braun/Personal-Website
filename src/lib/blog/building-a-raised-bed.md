In summer 2019 my girlfriend and I moved to a new location. Although it was possible to use the garden we wanted to have the possibility to plant something near the kitchen. So I decided to construct a raised bed with Inventor and calculated how much wood we needed.

With the arrival of the material we started the woordwork. 

During the work we discovered some limitations due to the available tools, so that it wasn't possible to follow the construction plan completely (I see there some similarities to the software development process 😁).

The raised bed got an additional task as visual cover.
