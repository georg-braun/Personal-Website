Motivated by building a raised bed we wanted to build a couch on our balcony.

After making some sketches and drafts in Inventor we ordered the wood (douglas).

Worplace outside to mill the wood.

Nightshift.

Once we finished the main components we made some test assemblies.

After the successful test assembly (it didn't collapse 😄) we started to assembly the couch on our balcony.

After the assembly we encountered some fallacies and we had to do some adjustments (shorten the pillar).

But the result is great.
