	<ul>
		<li>my girlfriend</li>
		<li>these two guys <img src={rockyElmoImage} alt="animals" /></li>
		<li>solving problems / do helpful stuff with software</li>
		<li>bicycles</li>

	</ul>
	<p class="mt-4">
		My blog is about projects, opinions, and problems I encounter as a software engineer. I think
		blogging has several advantages: reflection, learning by teaching, and offer hopefully some
		useful information.<br>
		Maybe there will sneak in some posts about my other interests ;)
